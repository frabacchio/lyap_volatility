# Chaos in financial time series
The presence of Chaos in financial time series has been discussed for a long time
and the debate about it is not still closed despite many literature did not find
evidence of it. Thanks to a Feed Forward Neural Network we were able to learn 
the financial time series behaviour providing an estimate of lyapunov exponent aimed to verify or not
the presence of chaos.
